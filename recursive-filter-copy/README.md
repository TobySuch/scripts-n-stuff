# Recursive Filter Copy (RFC)

## Aim
This script was the result of me having to copy a few thousand pictures from a directory tree with some other meta files which I did not want to include. The script looks through the directory tree recursively, checks for files which match the filter and copies them to the target directory. It then does the same to any child directories inside.

## Requirements
Python 3
